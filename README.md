# Pacmen Factory
> Create as many Pacmen and ghost as you want

## Description
> This project show three buttons on the screen. One let you add more pacmen on the screen at a random position. The second one let you create ghosts. The last one make them move.

## How to run
> Simply launch the index.html on your browser and you are good to go.

## Roadmap of future improvements
> Different improvements can me make. You could switch the pacman image by a svg and change its color. You could also make the pacman turn around. You could finally make the pacmen disapear when they touch a ghost. A button could reverse the dynamic and the pacmen could eat the ghosts.
